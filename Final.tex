  \Abstract{
    Efforts have been made to find an interpolary function for the grain boundary (GB) energies of uranium dioxide, based on work done by Bulatov \emph{et al.}[Acta Mater. 65, 161 (2014)]. A MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} script was developed based on Harbison[B.S. Thesis, Brigham Young University - Idaho (2015)] and Bulatov \emph{et al.}\ to perform this work. Molecular dynamics data was collected using the LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulation) program developed at Sandia National Laboratory. Results for the \textlangle{}100\textrangle{}, \textlangle{}110\textrangle{}, and \textlangle{}111\textrangle{} symmetric tilt and twist GBs have been collected. The new data sets were calculated with an 800 K anneal which allowed the atoms to relax to a lower energy state. An improved fit is found for the \textlangle{}100\textrangle{} and \textlangle{}110\textrangle{} symmetric tilt sets and the \textlangle{}110\textrangle{} twist set, whereas the \textlangle{}100\textrangle{} twist and \textlangle{}111\textrangle{} symmetric tilt and twist sets show unexpected trends. Further research needs to be done for the \textlangle{}100\textrangle{} and \textlangle{}111\textrangle{} sets to determine why the fitting procedure does not accurately reflect the expected results. Additional research should also be done to determine if outlying data points necessitate fitting additional cusps.

\chapter{Introduction\label{intro}}
Uranium dioxide (UO\textsubscript{2}) is the primary choice for nuclear fuel in today's reactors.\cite{uraniumInfo}  Understanding the properties of UO\textsubscript{2} requires an analysis of the basic crystal structure of the material.  UO\textsubscript{2} is a ceramic (a type of polycrystalline material), meaning that a series of crystal lattices join together in various ways (called twist, tilt, or mixed boundaries) to create it.  This material has a fluorite crystal structure, where the uranium atoms form a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, and the oxygen atoms form a simple cubic lattice within the fcc frame (see \Cref{fig:uo2Lattice}).

For a nuclear reactor to work properly, many things need to be taken into consideration.  First, understanding the ideal operating conditions for the nuclear reactor is important so immediate actions can be taken when conditions are no longer ideal.  Radioactivity has an effect on all materials, not just living tissue.  Over time, radiation can create defects in the crystal structures of the metals used to create the reactor shell, and these defects build up, causing deformation, weakening, or stiffening of the materials, which in turn can lead to problems if not properly managed.\cite{callister2003}.  As the reactions continue more neutrons are created, potentially causing additional fission events.  To prevent the reactor from having all the fuel fission at nearly the same time (releasing a large amount of energy), various methods control the number of chain reactions.  Emergency procedures also prevent catastrophes such as the ones that occurred at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima.

Second, the quality of the fuel must meet a minimum standard for a sustainable reaction to occur.  Nuclear fuels come in one of two categories: fissile, where bombardment of the material with neutrons will divide the atomic nuclei into ``daughter" particles, releasing energy; and non-fissile, where bombardment of the material results in the neutrons becoming part of the nucleus, called absorption.  Nuclear reactors require fissile materials to work.  One of the most common fissile materials is an isotope of uranium called U-235.  A second isotope of uranium, U-238, is much more common (approximately 99\% of all uranium).  Sustainable chain-reactions have a specific minimum amount of U-235 present in the fuel, depending on the moderating medium.\cite{uraniumInfo}

Third, the various properties of the fuel need to be well understood to make running the reactor as safe and effective as possible.  Some of these properties include thermal conductivity (how well heat flows through the material), fission gas release (how some of the fission products move throughout the material as gases), and mechanical stability (i.e. how the material bends or cracks under pressure or heat).  Taking thermal conductivity as an example, knowledge of this material property allows the most effective use of coolant to keep the reactor within operating temperatures, maximizing both efficiency and safety.  Knowledge of other material properties allows for similar gains in efficiency, safety, or both.


This work adds to the safety and efficiency of using nuclear energy by providing the necessary information to accurately calculate the material properties of UO\textsubscript{2} in-reactor.  Specifically, this work improves the fitting parameters for grain boundary (GB) energy interpolation for UO\textsubscript{2} by using molecular dynamics (MD) results calculated by Zhang\cite{zhang2016} and Hansen\cite{hansen2016} with an anneal of 800 K.  Previous data did not anneal the crystal structure\cite{harbison2015}, which prevented the atoms from finding their ideal energetic minimum.  The 800 K anneal allows the atoms to relax to a value closer to their global minimum, as shown in \Cref{results}.  A database will store these simulated energies, and a MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} script will use the database to fit the function parameters.  Idaho National Laboratory (INL) will incorpoate the updated parameters into its mesoscale phase field modeling platform MARMOT for use in modeling nuclear fuels.  As these parameters are implemented in the modeling software, various tests of the UO\textsubscript{2} fuel can determine how the material properties change while in-reactor.

\section{Background\label{intro:background}}
Polycrystalline materials (ceramics, metals, and polymers) are composed of tiny crystals called \emph{grains}.  The orientation of each grain is generally independent of the orientation in the grains surrounding it. Therefore, there is a possibility (depending on how the crystal formed\cite{callister2003}) that crystal structures will not line up at the interfaces where these two grains meet.  This ``atomic mismatch"\cite{callister2003} leads to broken or stretched atomic bonds where atoms will not line up relative to a perfect crystal structure.  These defects are called grain boundaries (GBs), and an illustration of a GB is shown in \Cref{fig:gb}. The most popular way to parameterize a GB uses the five degree-of-freedom (DoF) model.\cite{patala2013, lejcek2010, homer2015, bulatov2014, harbison2015, rohrer2011}.  This model only uses the macroscopic DoFs (the observable DoFs corresponding to the misorientation and inclination), ignoring the three translational DoFs (the ability of the grain to move or slide anywhere in space) possessed by each grain.  Three of the five DoFs specify the misorientation (or misaligment) of the grains with respect to each other.  The other two DoFs specify the orientation of the grain boundary plane (called the inclination).  The rotation axis and angle define the misorientation DoFs, and the GB normal defines the inclination DoFs.\cite{lejcek2010}

Three specific types of GBs occur in polycrystalline materials: twist, tilt, and mixed GBs.\cite{lejcek2010, rohrer2011}  These GBs desribe the misorientation of two grains with respect to each other.  Twist boundaries have the axis of rotation between the two grains and the GB normal parallel to each other. Tilt boundaries can be either symmetric and asymmetric.  A tilt boundary occurs when the axis of rotation between the two grains is perpendicular to the GB normal.  Symmetric tilt boundaries describe a GB whose boundary plane is a mirror plane: one side of the boundary mirrors the other.  This makes the angles between the boundary plane and the orientation axes of the two grains equal. Asymmetric tilt boundaries have unequal angles.  \Cref{fig:misorientation} shows a representation of tilt boundaries (top) and twist boundaries (bottom).  A mixed GB combines twist and tilt boundary characteristics.

Understanding GBs is important because of the effects they have on material properties.\cite{patala2013, homer2015, bulatov2014}  The crystal structure has extra energy because of the atomic mismatch at the boundaries.  This extra energy, called GB energy, gives rise to GB motion.  Knowing and predicting how the GBs will move allows for more accurate calculations of a material's properties.  Thus, GB energy needs to be understood to accurately model the evolution of material properties.

Two methods of modeling GB energy are the isotropic and anisotropic models.  The most common method (and easier method) is the isotropic model.  This model ignores the impact of inclination on the GB energy, and assumes equal inclinations for a given misorientation, reducing the five-dimensional (5D) parameter space to a three-dimensional (3D) parameter space.  The reasons for assuming this model historically were based on the assumption that the inclination had little or no impact on the GB energy, or (later) that it was too difficult to create a full five DoF model.\cite{homer2015}  Alternatively, the anisotropic approach seeks to quantify the effect that misorientation \emph{and} inclination have on the GB energy.  Currently, researchers acknowledge the need for a full five DoF model for GB energy, but assert the difficulty inherent in developing such a model.\cite{rohrer2011, lejcek2010, homer2015}  Despite these difficulties, GB energy functions for certain materials, namely fcc metals copper, gold, aluminum, and nickel, have proven successful.\cite{bulatov2014}

\section{Previous Work\label{intro:prevWork}}
Bulatov \emph{et al.}\cite{bulatov2014}\ developed a five DoF function which accurately interpolates GB energies for certain fcc metals.  They used energies for GBs along specific axes to interpolate the full 5D GB space.  \Cref{methods} explains their methods in more detail.  Harbison\cite{harbison2015} applied Bulatov \emph{et al.}'s methods to calculate similar parameters to describe the full five DoF GB space for UO\textsubscript{2}.  GB energies for various misorientations around a high-symmetry axis were gathered using MD simulations.  The fitting procedure created a set of 43 parameters defining the function needed to interpolate an arbitrary GB energy.

\chapter{Methods\label{methods}}
Sufficient data is a requirement for any fitting procedure, but unfortunately there is a lack of data on uranium dioxide (UO\textsubscript{2}) grain boundary (GB) energies in the literature.  As a work-around, this work used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\cite{zhang2016,hansen2016} as fitting data to calculate the GB energies of various lattices based on the coincident site lattice (CSL) model. This model builds off of the idea that the GB energy has lower values when more lattice sites coincide.  A number defined as the $\Sigma$-number describes the number of coincident sites per total number of lattice sites in a given unit cell of a crystal.\cite{lejcek2010, rohrer2011} This work developed a MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} script using Bulatov \emph{et al.}'s methods\cite{bulatov2014} and building off of Harbison's\cite{harbison2015} script to fit parameters to the gathered data.  A reduced chi-square statistic was calculated to determine the effectiveness of the fit.

\section{Molecular Dynamics\label{methods:MD}}
Simulation results from the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulation (LAMMPS) software (developed at Sandia National Laboratory\cite{plimpton1995}) were gathered for a number of twist, tilt, and mixed GBs.  These calculations were performed by simulating two crystals of UO\textsubscript{2} and placing them together in various orientations.  A GB is introduced at the interface, creating GB energy.  The energy of the system is calculated from the interatomic forces inside the crystal.  Comparing that energy to the energy of a single grain (of the same size as the combined two grains) of UO\textsubscript{2} determines the energy at the GB.\cite{harbison2015}  The GB energy is calculated as:\cite{butterfield2013}
\begin{equation}
E_{\textnormal{GB}}=\frac{|E_{\textnormal{single grain}} - E_{\textnormal{two grains}}|}{2*A_{\textnormal{GB}}}.
\end{equation} 
An example of how the atoms align is shown in \Cref{fig:lammps}. Harbison's original calculations\cite{harbison2015} were done using no anneal ($T_{\textnormal{max}}\approx0$ K), only allowing the atoms to relax to their local minima.  This work used an anneal of 800 K, allowing the atoms to relax to a better estimate of their global minimum value as shown in \Cref{results}.  This work used the same misorientation angles for the GB energy calculations that Harbison used.  The fitting procedure uses these energies to produce parameters describing the five-dimensional GB space.

\section{Bulatov \emph{et al.}'s Methods\label{methods:bulatov}}
This work implemented Bulatov \emph{et al.}'s hierarchical interpolation method to find the energy of an arbitrary GB in the five-space.\cite{bulatov2014}  They chose three three-dimensional (3D) axes with at least two-fold symmetry (called high-symmetry axes) to use as scaffolding to build the entire five-dimensional (5D) function.  The axes chosen for both Bulatov \emph{et al.}\ and this work were the \textlangle{}100\textrangle{}, \textlangle{}110\textrangle{}, and the \textlangle{}111\textrangle{} sets for their four-, two-, and three-fold rotational symmetries respectively.\footnote{For cubic crystals, rotations of 90\textdegree{}, 180\textdegree{}, or 120\textdegree{} about any \textlangle{}100\textrangle{}, \textlangle{}110\textrangle{}, or \textlangle{}111\textrangle{} axis respectively is a symmetry operation.\cite{stokes2007}  Thus, the \textlangle{}100\textrangle{} set is four-fold symmetric (360\textdegree{}$/90$\textdegree{}$=4$), the \textlangle{}110\textrangle{} set is two-fold symmetric (360\textdegree{}$/180$\textdegree{}$=2$), and the \textlangle{}111\textrangle{} set is three-fold symmetric (360\textdegree{}$/120$\textdegree{}$=3$).}  Each 3D subset builds from interpolation of its own one- and two-dimensional subsets.  The symmetric tilt and twist GBs for each set were fitted first because of their simplicity.  The rotation angle fully defines the energies for these subsets, making them one-dimensional (in \Cref{fig:bulatov5D}, the darker bands in the smaller circles).  From the symmetric tilt subset, the asymmetric, or general, tilt subset was interpolated.  A second rotation angle defining the rotation of the second grain makes this subset two-dimensional (the lighter, wider band of color around the symmetric subset).  A combination of the general tilt (two dimensions) and the twist subsets (one dimension) interpolates the 3D subset for each high-symmetry axis (the three smaller circles).  These three 3D subsets were then used to interpolate the GB 5D space.

Bulatov \emph{et al.}\ and this work used the Read-Shockley-Wolf (RSW) functions,\cite{wolf1989} which take the form:
\begin{equation}
E_{min} + (E_{max} - E_{min})\ \textnormal{sin}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{\theta-\theta_{min}}{\theta_{max} - \theta_{min}}\right)\left(1-a\textnormal{log}\left(\textnormal{sin}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{\theta-\theta_{min}}{\theta_{max} - \theta_{min}}\right)\right)\right),
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the misorientation angle, $\theta_{min}$ is the minimum angle on the domain, $\theta_{max}$ is the maximum angle on the domain, $a$ is a shaping parameter, and $E_{min}$ and $E_{max}$ represent the energy at $\theta_{min}$ and $\theta_{max}$ respectively.  Each RSW function covers a ``low-angle" subset (around 15\textdegree{}, with higher angles being less accurate)\cite{rohrer2011,wolf1989} of the domain in the 1D GB space.  An example of a simple RSW function is shown in \Cref{fig:RSW}.  Multiple RSW functions are stitched together to form the 1D subsets.

The unit vectors along the axis identify the boundary plane inclination in the frame of grain one.  A parallel vector thus represents a twist boundary, a perpendicular vector represents a tilt boundary, and neither parallel nor perpendicular vectors represent a mixed boundary.  The full misorientation space has 1152 symmetrically equivalent copies of the fundmental zone\cite{bulatov2014,randle2000} which allows the infinite nature of Rodrigues space to be accounted for.}

The RSW functions are scaled using $E_{min}$ and $E_{max}$.  In this example, $E_{min} = 0$ and $E_{max} = 1$.

\section{Representations of Grain Boundary Space\label{methods:GBReps}}
Part of Bulatov \emph{et al.}'s development of their 5D function was accomplished through visual representations of the GB space.  However, the size of the five-space in which GBs reside makes representing them difficult.  Different methods have been developed to represent them, each with their advantages and disadvantages.  Three of these methods are the axis-angle representation, the Rodrigues representation, and the fundamental zone representation.  These methods, though described separately, can be used together to form a better picture of what the GB space looks like (see for example \Cref{fig:bulatovRodrigues} which combines the Rodrigues representation and the fundamental zone representation).

\subsection{Axis-Angle Representation\label{GBReps:AA}}
The axis-angle representation is the simplest of the three described here.  The axis of rotation of the GB specifies the point in axis-angle space, and the angle of misorientation between the two grains at the GB specifies the magnitude of the vector.  Thus, the axis ($\bm{a}$, where $\bm{a}$ has components $a_x$, $a_y$, and $a_z$) and the angle ($\theta$) mathematically represent an axis-angle vector as:
\begin{equation}
\bm{A} = \bm{a}\ \theta
\label{eq:aaVec}
\end{equation} 

The axis-angle space can only take into account three degrees of freedom: the two angles specifying the axis, and the angle rotated through.  Thus, axis-angle space cannot fully visualize all of the necessary information contained in the full 5D space.\cite{frank1988} An added difficulty of using this representation is its infinite space because it maps an axis and an angle onto a Cartesian coordinate system.  This mapping means understanding the entire GB space is difficult without the help of additional methods.  The axis-angle representation is best used as a starting point to move to other, more robust representations, and to represent the misorientation between two grains.\cite{randle2000}

\subsection{Rodrigues Representation\label{GBReps:Rodrigues}}
The Rodrigues representation (sometimes called the ``Rodrigues-Frank" representation) uses Rodrigues vectors to represent rotations in Rodrigues space.  This representation takes ideas from the axis-angle space, but makes a few changes allowing crystal symmetries to be taken into account.  The axis about which a GB is oriented still specifies the point in space, but the tangent of half the angle represents the magnitude of the vector. Thus, a Rodrigues vector can be represented as:\cite{morawiec1996, becker1989, frank1988, randle2000, priester2013}
\begin{equation}
\bm{R}=\bm{a}\ \textnormal{tan}\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\label{eq:rodriguesVec}
\end{equation}
Some researchers favor this representation over others because of the lack of curvature such a mapping entails.\cite{frank1988, randle2000}  However, still only three of the five degrees of freedom are specified.  Bulatov \emph{et al.}\ attached a unit vector at the points along the axis to represent the other two DoFs in \Cref{fig:bulatovRodrigues}. A parallel vector represents a twist boundary, and a perpendicular vector represents a tilt boundary.  Anything else represents a mix of twist and tilt (or a mixed boundary).  One difficulty in using Rodrigues space is it also is an infinite space, as it also transforms an axis-angle pair into a Cartesian coordinates.\cite{frank1988, kirch2008}.

\subsection{Fundamental Zone Representation\label{GBReps:FunZone}}
The fundamental zone is perhaps the best graphical representation for the 5D GB.  This representation takes advantage of the symmetries inherent in crystals\cite{stokes2007} to simplify an infinite space into a compact, finite area called the fundamental zone.\cite{bulatov2014, patala2013, homer2015, morawiec1996, patala2012}  Every point within the space represents a unique orientation, and every point outside the space can be represented as a point inside the space through symmetry operations.\cite{morawiec1996, becker1989, frank1988}  Bulatov \emph{et al.}\ used this idea in connection with Rodrigues space to create \Cref{fig:bulatovRodrigues}.  In Rodrigues space, the crystal symmetries of the material determine the shape of the fundamental zone.\cite{patala2013, morawiec1996}  For fcc crystals, the fundamental zone takes the form of a truncated tetrahedron.\cite{bulatov2014}  The edges of the fundamental zone in Rodrigues space represent the high-symmetry rotation axes, and points on one face can represent another point on a different face of the fundamental zone.  

\section{Code Analysis\label{methods:code}}
Harbison\cite{harbison2015} and Bulatov \emph{et al.}\cite{bulatov2014}\ developed MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} scripts for their work.  This work analyzed these codes and used the ideas from them to develop the code that generated the parameters listed in \Cref{app:params}.

\subsection{The Fitting Code\label{code:fitting}}
This work performed an extensive analysis of Harbison's code to learn how it works and to implement the ideas therein.  The basic outline for the fitting procedure follows.  First, data is read in from a database containing energies associated with either a twist or tilt GB on one of the three high-symmetry axes.  Test parameters, used as starting points for the fitted parameters, are also read in from a separate database.  The parameters found from the 1D fits are used in fitting the higher-dimensional sets.  Important angles specify where low energies are expected, such as the $\Sigma5$ boundary for the \textlangle{}100\textrangle{} symmetric tilt subset.  These angles are calculated based on the $\Sigma$-number from CSL theory. Because the $\Sigma$-number designates how many lattice points  are between each coincident site (and assuming that the space between each lattice site, the lattice constant, is known) the angle of the GB misorientation can be determined.  Every energy in the parameter-vector is listed as a scaled value based on the $e_{RGB}$ parameter to minimize the potential for error in calculations. The $e_{RGB}$ parameter represents the energy of an arbitrary, random GB, and can be seen as an average of the material's GB energies.  Thus, to make relevant comparisons, the energies are unscaled based on the units of energy desired (typically J/m\textsuperscript{2}).  All of the parameters and the angle-energy pairs from the database are then passed into a grid-search fitting function.  This work gave each subset a different initial step size to avoid a numerical error where the steps would take the angles currently being looked at outside of their domain. Without this, the grid-search procedure would not return the correct amount of values, preventing the code from running to completion.

Once the six one-dimensional subsets and the three two-dimensional subsets are fitted, the three-dimensional subsets are fitted using the twist and asymmetric tilt subsets to calculate the mixing parameters (defining the relationship between the twist and general tilt subsets within a high-symmetry axis - i.e. the relationship between the small dark bands representing the twist boundaries and the lighter, wider bands representing the tilt boundaries in \Cref{fig:bulatov5D}).  The final step calculates the weighting parameters, which defines the relationship between the three high-symmetry subsets.  Equations defining the various relationships can be found in Bulatov \emph{et al.}'s work.\cite{bulatov2014}

\subsection{The Energy Calculation Code\label{code:energyCalc}}
Bulatov \emph{et al.}'s open-source MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} code\cite{bulatov2014}, \lstinline!GB5DOF.m!, calculates the energy of an arbitrary GB in certain fcc metals. This work uses this script for calculating an arbitrary GB in UO\textsubscript{2}, and proceeds as follows.  First, metrics defining the ``distance" between the GB and all three high-symmetry axes are calculated.  These distances are calculated by looking at all symmetrically equivalent representations of a GB on a per-axis basis (for cubic crystals, there are 24 equivalent representations\cite{stokes2007}).  Because there are three, six, and four unique axes for the \textlangle{}100\textrangle{}, \textlangle{}110\textrangle{}, and \textlangle{}111\textrangle{} axes respectively, a maximum of $6\times24=144$ distances are calculated.  Any distances exceeding a predefined cutoff distance are discarded.  After all distances have been calculated, only the unique representations are kept to avoid double-counting certain representations.\cite{bulatov2014}  Energies are calculated for each unique distance in each subset.  These energies are then weighted and summed to give the interpolated energy for the specified GB.

\section{Reduced Chi-Square Statistic\label{methods:chi2}}
A good way to test how well a function fits the data is to use a reduced chi-square goodness-of-fit statistic.\cite{bevington2003}  The orientation matrices (which Bulatov \emph{et al.}\ calls the P and Q matrices for the first and second grains respectively) were needed as input parameters to Bulatov \emph{et al.}'s function to calculate this statistic.  These three by three matrices specify the orientation in a lab frame of the two grains individually. A good fit will have a reduced chi-square value close to one, while those values greater than one indicate an under fit, and those values less than one indicate an over fit.\cite{bevington2003}

\subsection{Developing the P and Q Matrices\label{chi2:PQ}}
Creating the P and Q matrices was a non-trivial task.  Because there has been so much work done with crystallography over the past few decades, many different methods have been developed to specify the orientation matrices of grains. A rotation matrix also needed to be calculated which rotates the axis of rotation to the [100] direction, as Bulatov \emph{et al.}'s energy calculation code assumes.  Three methods, following the method prescribed in MARMOT, using the Rodrigues rotation formula, and using the Bunge rotation matrix, were used in this work in the process of developing these matrices and are described below.

\subsubsection{MARMOT Method\label{PQ:MARMOT}}
MARMOT, Idaho National Laboratory's (INL's) mesoscale phase-field modeling platform,\cite{tonks2012} calculates the P and Q matrices for the grains using Euler angles as input parameters.  The Euler angles are converted to the orientation matrices using the Bunge convention, i.e. the $ZXZ$ or $ZX'Z''$ rotation, where the first rotation is about the \emph{z} axis, the second rotation is around the new \emph{x} axis, and the final rotation is about the new \emph{z} axis.  The formula for this conversion from Bunge Euler angles to the rotation matrix is found by multiplying the \emph{z}, \emph{x}, and \emph{z} rotation matrices together in that order to get:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bungeMat}
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
c_1\ c_3 - c_2\ s_1\ s_3 & -c_1\ s_3 - c_2\ c_3\ s_1 & \phantom{-}s_1\ s_2 \\
c_3\ s_1 + c_1\ c_2\ s_3 & \phantom{-}c_1\ c_2\ c_3 - s_1\ s_3 & -c_1\ s_2 \\
s_2\ s_3 & \phantom{-}c_3\ s_2 & \phantom{-}c_2 
\end{array}
\right]
\end{equation}
where $c_\textnormal{n}$ and $s_\textnormal{n}$ represent the cosine and sine of the respective angles (1 represents the first \emph{z} rotation, 2 represents the \emph{x} rotation, and 3 represents the second \emph{z} rotation.  These angles are usually referred to as\cite{randle2000} $\varphi_1$, $\Phi$, $\varphi_2$).

The rotation matrix is calculated in MARMOT by using the GB normal and finding the rotation matrix required to rotate that vector to the [100] direction.  In MARMOT, simulations are set up through input files.  In the input files different sections (called blocks) specify material parameters, boundary conditions, initial conditions, and the physical models to use to solve the problem (among others).  The initial condition used to calculate the rotation matrices in MARMOT for this set of problems was a horizontal or vertical line for tilt or twist boundaries respectively.  Because of this set up, the GB normals were either along the [010] axis for the tilt boundaries, or [$\bar{1}$00] for twist boundaries.

\subsubsection{Rodrigues Rotation Formula\label{PQ:RRF}}
The Rodrigues rotation formula\cite{belongie2006} (RRF) calculates the rotation matrices given an axis and an angle using the following formula:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rrf}
\bm{R} = \bm{I} + \textnormal{sin}\ \theta\ \bm{K} + (1 - \textnormal{cos}\ \theta)\ \bm{K}^2,
\end{equation}
where $\bm{I}$ is the 3x3 identity matrix, $\theta$ is the angle rotated through, and $\bm{K}$ is the skew-symmetric matrix formed by the axis of rotation ($\bm{a}$) by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:skewSymMat}
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\phantom{-}0 & -a_z & \phantom{-}a_y \\
\phantom{-}a_z & \phantom{-}0 & -a_x \\
-a_y & \phantom{-}a_x & \phantom{-}0
\end{array}
\right]
\end{equation}

This work calculated the rotation matrices two different ways with this orientation matrix formulation.  The first method simply used the MARMOT-generated rotation matrices.  A second method calculated the rotation matrices using geometric arguments (see \Cref{fig:PlaneNorms}).  From the geometric arguments the normals are identified in \Cref{table:geometricgbnorms}.  \Cref{app:RotationMatrix} shows the code used to generate the rotation matrices.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Bunge Rotation Matrix\label{PQ:BungeMat}}
MARMOT uses the Bunge rotation matrix (see \Cref{eq:bungeMat}) to create the orientation matrices.  This work used various methods to calculate the Euler angles, of which three are briefly described here. The Euler angles (once calculated) were used in the first two methods to calculate the entirety of the rotation matrix.

First, this work tried to use scripts developed to calculate the various Euler angles for MARMOT.  These scripts did not work because of the same assumptions made earlier about the orientation of the GB, namely, that all pure tilt GBs have a normal of 010, and that all pure twist GBs have a normal of $\bar{1}$00.  The difference between MARMOT's boundary conditions and the boundary conditions of this work is that GBs in this work are assumed to be either perpendicular or parallel to the rotation axis, as opposed to always being along the $x$- or $y$-axis.

The second method used an open-source MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} package called MTEX.\cite{bachmann2010}  This package calculates Euler angles using quaternions.  These Euler angles did not generate the correct results either, for the most part creating the same sorts of graphs as the MARMOT method.  It is uncertain why this method did not work.

The working method used the mathematics of quaternions directly.\cite{weisstein2004}  The quaternions were calculated based on the misorientation axis and angle.  A quaternion is a four-dimensional vector containing one real part, and three imaginary parts.  The components of the vector are calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:quat}
\bm{q}=\left[\textnormal{cos}\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right),\ a_x\,\textnormal{sin}\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right),\ a_y\,\textnormal{sin}\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right),\ a_z\,\textnormal{sin}\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right],
\end{equation}
with axis $\bm{a}$ and misorientation angle $\theta$.  After converting the axis and misorientation angle to a quaternion, another conversion from a quaternion to the Bunge Euler angles is performed.  The angles are calculated using the \lstinline!atan2! method which allows for all four quadrants in the Cartesian space to be accounted for.  The angles are calculated using the following formulas:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:quat2euler}
\begin{aligned}
\chi &= \sqrt{(q_0^2+q_3^2)(q_1^2+q_2^2)}\\
\varphi_1 &= \textnormal{atan2}\left(\frac{q_0q_2+q_1q_3}{2\chi}, \frac{q_0q_1-q_2q_3}{2\chi}\right)\\
\Phi &= \textnormal{atan2}\left(2\chi, q_0^2+q_3^2-q_1^2-q_2^2\right)\\
\varphi_2 &= \textnormal{atan2}\left(\frac{q_1q_3-q_0q_2}{2\chi}, \frac{q_0q_1+q_2q_3}{2\chi}\right).
\end{aligned}
\end{align}
Once the Euler angles were calculated, they were put into \Cref{eq:bungeMat}, and the resulting matrices were used as the orientation for the grains.  The codes used to generate the orientation matrices can be found in \Cref{app:OrientationMatrix,app:genOrientationMatrix}.

\subsubsection{Testing The Matrices\label{PQ:Testing}}
This work attempted to reproduce the 1D subset graphs as shown in Bulatov \emph{et al.}\ as a way to test the different methods.  Various levels of success were observed for the different methods.  The matrices giving the best results are shown in \Cref{appfig:compare100,appfig:compare110,appfig:compare111}.

While the first method works well for MARMOT, the challenge accompanying its use was that MARMOT specifies a specific GB normal with the set up of the problem that is not necessarily what the MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} script expects.  Thus, the results coming from using this combination of matrices ended up working only for the \textlangle{}100\textrangle{} tilt, \textlangle{}110\textrangle{} tilt, and \textlangle{}100\textrangle{} twist subsets. The \textlangle{}110\textrangle{} twist had issues with singularities, and the \textlangle{}111\textrangle{} subsets did not remotely match the expected outcome.

\subsection{Calculating Reduced Chi Squared\label{chi2:chi2red}}
There were two methods that this work used to calculate the $\chi^2_{red}$ statistic.  The first method used the P and Q matrices as developed above to test the entirety of the fit.  The second method calculated the statistic for each 1D subset, then calculated the full $\chi^2_{red}$ value using the statistics from the subsets.  Results from these calculations are discussed in the next chapter.

The test for the entire fit used the P and Q matrices to calculate the energy in 1\textdegree{} intervals for each subset, using Bulatov \emph{et al.}'s \lstinline!GB5DOF.m! script.  The $\chi_{\textnormal{red}}^2$ value was calculated for each subset and for the entire fit using \Cref{eq:chi2}, producing the results in \Cref{table:chi2} under the 800 K anneal column under the ``$\chi_{\textnormal{red}}^2$ using P and Q matrices" section.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:chi2}
\chi^2_{\textnormal{red}} = \frac{1}{N-n-1} \sum \frac{(\epsilon_{\textnormal{md}} - \epsilon)^2}{e\ \epsilon_{\textnormal{md}}}.
\end{equation}
In this equation, $N$ is the number of observations, $n$ is the number of parameters, $\epsilon_{\textnormal{md}}$ are the energies from MD, $\epsilon$ are the energies from the model, and $e$ is the uncertainty in the MD results.

Using the second method, the same angles used in the fitting procedure were used in the RSW equations creating the 1D subsets.  The differences between the values resulting from there and the MD simulation values lead to the $\chi_{\textnormal{red}}^2$ values shown in the 800 K anneal column under the $\chi_{\textnormal{red}}^2$ comparing the 1D fits section.  The same methods were implemented to calculate the $\chi_{\textnormal{red}}^2$ values for the data without an anneal.

The statistic calculated using these methods is different from the $\chi^2$ statistic used in the grid-search function.  The grid search used \Cref{eq:chi2grid}, and generated values of the same order as \Cref{eq:chi2}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:chi2grid}
\chi^2=\sum (E_{\textnormal{measured}} - E_{\textnormal{calculated}})^2
\end{equation}

\chapter{Results and Discussion\label{results}}
\section{Validation of P and Q Matrices\label{results:PQValid}}
The energy profiles calculated from the P and Q matrices were compared with the copper energy profiles expected from the parameters defined in Bulatov \emph{et al.}'s code to validate the generated P and Q matrices.  Results from this comparison for the \textlangle{}100\textrangle{} set are shown in \Cref{fig:compare100}, with all six subsets shown in \Cref{appfig:compare100,appfig:compare110,appfig:compare111}.  The calculated energies match exactly the predicted values for all but a few points.  Each data set does not match the expected energy at 1\textdegree{}, and the tilt data sets also see this mismatch at their second to last data point.

\end{figure}

\section{Fitting Results\label{results:fit}}
Comparisons for the one-dimensional (1D) results from Harbison\cite{harbison2015} and this work are presented in \Cref{fig:100,fig:110,fig:111}.  The results show a general decrease in the grain boundary (GB) energies, allowing trends in the different subsets to emerge.  These trends allow for an all around better fit, but there are still some unexpected results present.  The parameters calculated from the fitting procedure are shown in \Cref{app:params}.

Initial MD recalculations of the \textlangle{}100\textrangle{} symmetric tilt GB energies using the 800 K anneal (\Cref{fig:100Tilt}) showed an unexpected deep cusp around 28\textdegree{}.  An analysis of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results for this misorientation revealed that, in this case, the two crystals had realigned during the simulation due to abnormally high pressures.  This realignment caused the misorientation angle to change causing the GB energy to be much lower than expected.  Comparison with Harbison's simulation result revealed that the crystal structure from his simulation did not realign.  While Harbison's data was not calculated with the anneal and thus may not represent a global minimum, the data point follows the surrounding data's trend, justifying the use of his result.

Of the symmetric tilt GB energy sets, the \textlangle{}110\textrangle{} set has the most improvement.  All three sets showed a general decrease in the energy, increasing confidence in the accuracy of the fit for GB energies in uranium dioxide (UO\textsubscript{2}).  However, each of these sets provides more opportunity for research.  The \textlangle{}100\textrangle{} set needs more work done for data points after around 50\textdegree{}.  The scatter associated with those points seems to be higher, and the possibility of a slight cusp presents itself around 68\textdegree{}.  It is unknown what behaviors are expected there though because of the limited data in that region, so additional data would prove beneficial.  The \textlangle{}110\textrangle{} set as mentioned shows the most improvement, but some low points in the second and third ``humps" do not follow the trend, indicating further possibility for cusps.  The first part of the function (the first hump) needs additional data to determine the possibility of a cusp between 40\textdegree{} and 50\textdegree{}.  The fitted curve to the \textlangle{}111\textrangle{} set now has an unexpected upward trend.  The relatively high scatter associated with these data points leads to the possibility of a completely different set of functions to define this subset, meaning additional RSW functions would be required for example.

The twist GB energy sets vary in their success.  The \textlangle{}100\textrangle{} set shows little difference between Harbison's \cite{harbison2015} work and this work.  An unexpected slight positive concavity at the end of the fitting for this subset indicates the possibility of a cusp.  This cusp may occur around 30\textdegree{}.  The \textlangle{}110\textrangle{} set has a definite decrease in the overall energies, creating a plateau profile.  An additional cusp around 40\textdegree{} is being considered.  The \textlangle{}111\textrangle{} set has the least improvement.  From the Bulatov \emph{et al.}'s work\cite{bulatov2014} this work expected to see a plateau as Harbison's fitting demonstrated.\cite{harbison2015}  Instead, the fitting produced a curved energy profile, indicating the potential for at least one cusp.  A possible location of this cusp is around 35\textdegree{}.  Preliminary work has been done with changing the number of parameters in an effort to maximize the quality of the fit with a minimal number of parameters. \Cref{fig:updatedGraphs} compares the current fitting to the tentative new fitting for three of the six 1D subsets.  These modified fits in general seem to fit better at the cost of additional parameters, with a smaller $\chi_{\textnormal{red}}^2$ value.  Still more parameters may be needed to accommodate additional cusps however.

\Cref{fig:100PQ} shows the comparison between the values calculated from the P and Q matrices and the expected values from the MD calculations for the \textlangle{}100\textrangle{} subset.  All six subsets are shown in \Cref{appfig:100PQ,appfig:110PQ,appfig:111PQ} in \Cref{app:graphs}.  There is an unsolved scaling issue with the \textlangle{}100\textrangle{} tilt subset.  Overall, the results from the P and Q matrices match the fitted values, with a few anomalies needing to be addressed.

The positive concavity in the twist subset around 40\textdegree{} is unexpected, and may indicate the presence of a missing cusp.  There is a possible cusp around 30\textdegree{} in the twist subset, and around 68\textdegree{} in the tilt subset. }

MD results are shown for reference. \protect\subref{fig:updated100Twist} shows a possible change from the Read-Shockley-Wolf (RSW) functions to a simple square root function multiplied by an exponential decay.  There is no theoretical basis behind this change however. \protect\subref{fig:updated110Twist} attempts to fit to a cusp around 40\textdegree{}.  Further work can be done to find a better fit for this subset. \protect\subref{fig:updated111Twist} shows the most potential improvement.  The potential fit increases the total number of parameters by three to fit to the cusp around 28\textdegree.  A quick glance at the MD values compared to the fit shows a great improvement from the current fit.  To create the graph shown in \protect\subref{fig:updated111Twist} two additional RSW functions were spliced into the original function.  This created a total of four RSW functions for this subset. \textcolor{red}{Should I include the actual code that makes these changes?}}

\section{Reduced Chi-square Results\label{results:chi2red}}
The $\chi_{\textnormal{red}}^2$ values are much smaller than one for every data set regardless of the method used to calculate the statistic, with the exception of the \textlangle{}100\textrangle{} symmetric tilt subset using the P and Q matrices.  This subset has a high $\chi_{\textnormal{red}}^2$ value due to the scaling issue.  Because of the low $\chi_{\textnormal{red}}^2$ values, the fitted functions overfit the data.\cite{bevington2003}  \Cref{table:chi2} lists the $\chi_{\textnormal{red}}^2$ values for the 1D subsets using the two different methods for calculation.

\chapter{Conclusion\label{conclusion}}
This work has successfully created a more accurate interpolation function for grain boundary (GB) energies in uranium dioxide (UO\textsubscript{2}), but additional characteristics of the full five-dimensional (5D) GB space have been revealed that require further research.  GB energies were found to be lower when calculated with an 800 K anneal as expected when compared to the data set created without an anneal.  Descriptions of those additional characteristics through the use of additional functions will prove beneficial.  

The most important work yet to be done is calculation of additional data points for fitting.  Increasing the number of data points will improve the quality of the fit.  Additional data points will also help to identify trends that do not readily appear with the limited data currently available.  The difficulty associated with calculating additional data points is the required computational resources.  %Each data point (148 GB energies calculated) represents approximately one days' worth of computation time using INL's high performance computing system.  Thus, additional GB energies would take considerable time and resources. <-- This is more of a methods thing.  The second sentence might even belong more in results/discussion.

Further work could generalize this function to all polycrystalline materials with the fluorite crystal structure.  Such a generalization would provide further validation of this model, however, such validation would require a sufficient number of GB energies for many different materials with such a structure.  As these energies are not already available in the literature, this would require additional computational resources.  As the parameters for GB energy interpolation are improved and validated, they should be incorporated into MARMOT to further the anisotropic grain growth model being developed.

As the model is developed, initial conditions set by actual nuclear fuel data will be put into a MARMOT simulation.  After simulating grain growth in a nuclear reactor, the fuel data will be compared with the simulation data to determine the accuracy of the model.
